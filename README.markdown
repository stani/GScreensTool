GScreensTool

This a little screenshot tool for Windows that can take and save sceenshots from DirectX games and other applications.  
Also shows FPS and time. 

Press screenshot key to save a screenshot, long press to toggle interval capture mode.

Requires SlimDX (http://slimdx.org/)

Works ok with dx9, less ok with dx10 and 11. Code is a mess right now.
